# Hotel_BookingCancellation_MiniProject
In recent years, City Hotel and Resort have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is now dealing with a number of  issues as a result, including fewer revenues.
The analysis of hotel booking cancellations as well as other factors that have no bearing on their business and yearly revenue generation are the main topic of this data analysis.
Assumptions:
1. No unusual occurences between 2015 and 2017 will have a substantial impact on the data used.
2. The information is still current and can be used to analyze a hotel's possible plans in an efficient manner.
3. There are no unanticipated negatives to the hotel employing any advised technique.
4. The hostels are not currently using any of the suggested solutions.
5. The biggest factor affecting the effectiveness of earning income is booking cancellations.
6. Cancellations result in vacant rooms for the booked length of time.
7. Clients make hostel reservations the same year they make cancellations.

Research Questions:
1. What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations ?
2. How can we make hotel reservations cancellations better ?
3. HOw will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotioal decisions ?

Hypothesis:
1. More cancellations occur when prices are higher.
2. When there is a longer waiting list, customers tend to cancel more frequently.
3. The majority of clients are coming from offlie travel to meke their reservations.

Suggestions:
1. Cancellation artes rise as the price does. In order to prevent cancellations of reservations, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels based on locations. They can also provide some discunts to the customer.
2. As the ratio of the cancellation and not cancellation f the resort hotel is higher in the resort hotel than the city hotels. So the hotel should provide a resonable discount on the room prices on weekends or on holidays.
3. In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a reasonable amount to increase their revenues as the cancellation is the highest in this month.
4. They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate.
